               Su Dongpo is one of the most famous and legendary poets in Chinese history. His fame is not only because of his peerless masterpieces but also the ups and downs in his life.
               In this data video, we use a novel visualization HoagsOLife contructed by D3.js, in reference to Hoag's Object, to present a story about Dongpo's life journey, his poems,
               and the dishes he created.
               <br>
               <br>
               Using this metaphor, HoagsOLife is composed of chronic rings, extended branches, and an interactive core, encoding his life trajectory, the dishes, and the poems accordingly.
               <br>
               <br>
               The input data is publicly available. NLP techniques, including TF-IDF and sentiment analysis, are also adopted as supports to our study.

               Through exploration, we find Dongpo's desire and the efficiency of writing and expressions used in poems were closely related to his political status. Meanwhile, even in a challenging situation, Dongpo
              could overcome the sadness by creating foods as joy.
               <br>
               <br>
               HoagsOLife consists of three layers. The outer-most layer represents the places Dongpo visited and the distance from the capital of Song dynasty; the middle layer shares the
               same timeline as the previous layer, showing the poems Dongpo created. In the inner-most layer, NLP technics were applied to demonstrate keywords of poems created during that
               stage. Some stars in the outer canextend out more related planets, representing Su Dongpo's famous dishes at this place.
