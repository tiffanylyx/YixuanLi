              In the era when everything enters artificial intelligence, the museum industry has gradually begun to apply artificial intelligence technology for museum management, curating, and guided tours.
              This article hopes to provide a certain degree of image recognition technology reference and application exploration for the museum staff from the technical perspective of the intersection of
              computer and museum. This article takes the most widely used image recognition technology in artificial intelligence technology as an example to analyze the development law and multiple application scenarios of image recognition technology in the museum industry.

              Combining the latest technology in the field of artistic image recognition, as well as the subject and many domestic and foreign image recognition projects that have been implemented, it summarizes the three advantages of "small data", "big data" and interactive modes of image recognition technology in digital content curation.
              Meanwhile, the paper demonstrates the egoism and altruism of the application of image recognition technology in museums, analyzes the challenges and development directions that still exist in the development of this technology in the museum field, and puts forward feasibility suggestions for the current stage of museum image recognition project construction.
